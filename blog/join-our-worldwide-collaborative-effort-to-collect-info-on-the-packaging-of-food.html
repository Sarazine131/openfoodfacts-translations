<div><em>The </em><a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://fr.openfoodfacts.org"><em>Open Food Facts</em></a><em> project </em><em>references information (ingredients, nutrition, labels, etc.) for 1.5 million products around the world (including more than 700,000 for France). It has made it possible to create more than 100 apps and services that millions of people use every day to choose healthier foods. Our database is also a valuable tool for research teams studying the impact of diet on our health.</em></div>
<div><strong>We are now working with other players committed to creating the Eco-score which will allow everyone to take into account the environmental impact of products quickly and easily,</strong> just as the Nutri-Score does for nutritional quality of food.</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br /> <img src="https://fr.blog.openfoodfacts.org/images/grand_recensement_des_emballages.jpg" alt="Large inventory of packaging for all food products" width="599" height="282" /><br /> </div>
<div>One of the components of the Eco-score is the impact of packaging on the environment: raw materials and resources for their production, and their reuse or end of life (reuse, recycling, incineration or landfill).</div>
<div>For that, <strong>we need very precise information on all the components of the packaging of all food products:</strong> their number, their shape, their capacity, their material, the origin of this material (recycled or not), the instructions of sorting etc.</div>
<div><strong>This is where we need you: together we have successfully listed the ingredients and nutritional information for 1.5 million products. Now let's do the same for the packaging!</strong></div>
<div>Here is how to participate in this great packaging census:</div>
<div><strong>1. Open your fridge or cupboard and choose a product.</strong></div>
<div>Take for example a bottle of milk.<br /> <br /> <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/produit/3257980269010/lait-demi-ecreme-nature-bio"><img src="https://fr.blog.openfoodfacts.org/images/bouteille_de_lait.jpg" alt="What is this bottle of milk ?" width="126" height="300" /></a></div>
<div><strong>2. Use the Open Food Facts app to scan this product and add photos of anything that provides information on the packaging.</strong></div>
<div>The sorting instructions will allow us to determine what are the different elements that make up the packaging, what their material is, and whether or not they are recyclable.</div>
<div><img src="https://fr.blog.openfoodfacts.org/images/consignes_de_tri.jpg" alt="Sorting instructions" width="300" height="254" /><br /> <br /> The easiest way to take and send us the photo of the sorting instructions is to use the <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/application-mobile-open-food-facts">Open Food Facts</a> app . The new Android and iPhone version now have an "Environment" tab with a dedicated button (You can also use the "Send another photo" button).<br /> <br /> <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/application-mobile-open-food-facts"><img src="https://fr.blog.openfoodfacts.org/images/recycling.png" alt="Open Food Facts App" width="598" height="347" /></a></div>
<div><strong>For this information to be more precise and more useful, you must also transform yourself into a detective,</strong> with a cap but above all a magnifying glass to look for all the clues that will allow us to determine the exact materials. It's good to know that a bottle is made of plastic, but it's even better if you know that it's made of recycled PET!</div>
<div>To do this, you have to look for all the small logos or codes that appear on the packaging. In particular, plastic packaging almost always has a number in a triangle that indicates the type of plastic, this is called the &ldquo;resin code&rdquo;. If you find it, take a picture of it too.</div>
<div><img src="https://fr.blog.openfoodfacts.org/images/bouteille_lait_pe_hd_02.jpg" alt="PE-HD" width="300" height="300" />&nbsp;<img src="https://fr.blog.openfoodfacts.org/images/bouteille_lait_couvercle_pe_hd_02.jpg" alt="HDPE" width="300" height="300" /></div>
<div><em>HDPE / HDPE opaque plastic bottle and cap.&nbsp;</em><em>The indication of the plastic used is well hidden under the cap!</em></div>
<div><strong>3. Fill in the packaging information on the Open Food Facts site</strong></div>
<div>Thanks to the photos that you add to the products via the Open Food Facts app, you can then complete the product sheets on <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://fr.openfoodfacts.org">the Open Food Facts site</a> (we will try to make all of this possible directly in the app, but for now it is is easier on the site).</div>
<div>Modify the product sheet, and in the part dedicated to packaging (&ldquo;packaging&rdquo;), select the photo of the sorting instructions. If the instructions are also indicated in the form of text (such as &ldquo;Plastic bottle to recycle, plastic film to throw away&rdquo;), a button allows you to automatically extract this information.</div>
<div><img src="https://fr.blog.openfoodfacts.org/images/consignes_dessins.jpg" alt="Sorting instructions - logos" width="598" height="151" /></div>
<div><em>We haven't yet created a system to automatically recognize designs, but we will work on it!</em></div>
<div>Then complete this information so that it is as precise as possible:</div>
<ul>
<li>add the number: is there a bottle or 6 bottles?</li>
<li>add the capacity: is it a 1 L bottle or 25 cl bottles</li>
<li>specify the material as much as possible: is the plastic transparent, colored or opaque? If you have found a small code like PET or PE-HD, and / or a number in a triangle, now is the time to write them down.</li>
</ul>
<div>For example for our milk bottle:</div>
<ul>
<li>1 opaque PE-HD plastic bottle of 1L to recycle</li>
<li>1 opaque PE-HD plastic cap to be recycled</li>
<li>1 metal cover to be recycled</li>
<li>1 recycled paper label</li>
</ul>
<div>Validate the product sheet, and you can then check that the information you have indicated has been recognized and structured:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="col">Number</th>
<th scope="col">Form</th>
<th scope="col">Material</th>
<th scope="col">Recycling</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Bottle (1l)</td>
<td>HDPE - High density polyethylene</td>
<td>To recycle</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Bottle cap</td>
<td>HDPE - High density polyethylene</td>
<td>To recycle</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Operculum</td>
<td>Metal</td>
<td>To recycle</td>

<td>To recycle</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div><strong>4. Jump for joy!</strong></div>
<div>All is well ? Then proudly proclaim to the world, on Twitter, Facebook and / or Open Food Facts Slack, that thanks to you, one more product is participating in the great packaging census!<br /> <br />
<div><iframe title="Twitter Tweet" src="https://platform.twitter.com/embed/Tweet.html?dnt=false&amp;embedId=twitter-widget-0&amp;frame=false&amp;hideCard=false&amp;hideThread=false&amp;id=1327262080437727233&amp;lang=en&amp;origin=https%3A%2F%2Ftranslate.googleusercontent.com%2Ftranslate_f&amp;theme=light&amp;widgetsVersion=e1ffbdb%3A1614796141937&amp;width=550px" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-tweet-id="1327262080437727233"></iframe></div>
<br /> </div>
<div>Of course all these photos and information to enter, it may seem a bit long, but the rewards are worth the effort. And it would only take one in 100 French people to add information on a single product so that tomorrow we will have information on all the products currently sold in France!</div>
<div>This calculation takes into account the participation of children, who can be of great help in finding all the little codes on the packaging. :) We hope that many of you, young and old, will take part in identifying as many products as possible in your cupboards and helping us to finish this census as soon as possible.</div>
<div><strong>Very useful information for multiple uses!</strong></div>
<div>In addition to allowing the calculation of the Eco-score, this information on packaging will be available free of charge and freely for many other uses. For example, all the apps to help recycle or measure our packaging consumption, but also to advance research.</div>
<div>Open Food Facts collaborates in particular with EREN, the research team that created the Nutri-Score. The information that we will collect will be very useful for them to study the long-term impact on health of materials that come into contact with food.</div>
<div><strong>We count on you !</strong></div>
<div>For more information, or simply to let us know about your participation in this mission, we also invite you to <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.facebook.com/groups/openfoodfacts.fr">join the community of Open Food Facts contributors on our Facebook group</a> and on <a href="https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;prev=_t&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://slack.openfoodfacts.org">our discussion and collaboration tool Slack</a> . <br /> <br /> Update: iPhone version released (21 dec 2020)<br /> </div>
